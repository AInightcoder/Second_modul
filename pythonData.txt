    EX: AGE=34
    PRINT("MY AGE" +STR(AGE))

    B)  WE WILL LEARN THE COLCULAETE THE MATH EXERCISES

       INT_NUM=45*6*8-45/3  # THIS IS FOR INTEGER
       PRINT(INT_NUM) 
       
       FLOAT_NUM=3.458+35  #THIS IS FOR FLOAT && DOUBLE
       PRINT(FLOAT_NUM)

       SUBSTANTION IN FLOAT AND  INTEGER 

       INT_NUM=45 // 5
       NARTIJA: 9
       FLOAT_NUM=45/8
   C) WE CAN USE MULTIPLE LINE TO DO SEVERAL LINE EXERCISES 
   """
   ----------
   ---------

   """

   # ---------- THIS IS COMMIT
